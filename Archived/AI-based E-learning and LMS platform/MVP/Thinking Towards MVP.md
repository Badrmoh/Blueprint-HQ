  

1️⃣ **Start with the Problem Statement**

• What problem does your product solve?

• Who is your ideal customer?

  

2️⃣ **Define the Core Value Proposition**

• What is the simplest version of your solution that delivers value?

• Example: Uber’s core MVP feature was “Request a ride via an app”—not ratings, maps, or multiple ride types.

  

3️⃣ **List All Possible Features (Brainstorm)**

• Write down every feature that could be useful.

  

4️⃣ **Prioritize Using MoSCoW Method**

• **MUST-HAVE** – Essential for MVP (e.g., sign-up, payment processing).

• **SHOULD-HAVE** – Important but not necessary for MVP.

• **COULD-HAVE** – Nice but not needed yet.

• **WON’T-HAVE** – Can wait for later.

  

5️⃣ **Build a Simple Feature Map**

• Define what will be included in MVP vs. later versions.
