## Notes
- We need to reevaluate our business idea, i.e. LMS
	- What is the type of learning do we imagine to take place in the upcoming years?
		- Humans will focus on creativity, ethics, and emotional intelligence, while AI handles data analysis, repetitive tasks, and knowledge retrieval. Critical thinking will replace rote memorization.
		- AI will analyze individual learning styles, cognitive patterns, and emotional states to tailor content in real time. For example, a student struggling with calculus might receive customized problem sets, while another excelling in literature could be guided toward advanced critical analysis.
		- AI will embed education into daily routines—e.g., language practice via AR glasses during commutes, or coding tutorials integrated into workflow tools like GitHub Copilot.
		- Traditional degrees may coexist with **micro-credentials** issued by AI for mastery of specific skills (e.g., "Advanced Python for AI Engineering," validated by an AI-assessed project).
		- **Just-in-Time Learning**: Repairing a car? AR overlays guided by AI diagnose issues and teach mechanics on the spot.

> [!NOTE]
> 		- Types of things that AI cant fill such as critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and ethics, are type of things that would make a good opportunities.
> 		- Optimzing Learning Paths through micro-credentials about speicific skills that is manged and assesed by AI. E.g. AI-tutor that guides a student in python ai course and issue a credentials aftwards. Teachers will only focus on main skills, like teaching how to learn (learning theory) and emotional intelligence.
> 		- Real-time learning: reparing a car, and fixing a computer. We can build something on top of Google Studio AI!
