## Notes
- Instead of learning the details and technicalities of Pentesting:
	- Learn about standards and workflows
	- How to prepare data for Context, and RAG
		- Data sources
		- Strategies how to ingest data
- Business Idea:
	- API for integration with hostinger or similar services to scan websites before publishing
	- A button in hostinger ai website builder that enables scanning the website for vulnerabilities
	- Out Solution should then receive then a url for the code or the code it self (the main idea is that the app should be deployed in a sandbox)
	- Our solution performs pentesting and generates assestment report and return it to hostinger
	- hostinger could use that report to patch the code
