# Notes
- most e-learning platforms forcus either on simplicity (e.g. Udemy) or Profesionallisim (e.g. Udacity). This makes these platforms attract certain type of content creators
	- e.g. if a content creator wants simple course upload and sell, then he's most likely to use Udemy
	- I assume that's why platforms like coursera Udacity and edx has only institute and enterprise level programs
- Which LLMs support Arabic?
	- "Monta AI" did something about Arabic PDF text extraction
