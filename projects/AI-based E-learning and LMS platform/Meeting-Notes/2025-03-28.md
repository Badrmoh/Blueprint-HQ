## Notes
- We need to reevaluate our business idea, i.e. LMS
	- What is the type of learning do we imagine to take place in the upcoming years?
		- Humans will focus on creativity, ethics, and emotional intelligence, while AI handles data analysis, repetitive tasks, and knowledge retrieval. Critical thinking will replace rote memorization.
		- AI will analyze individual learning styles, cognitive patterns, and emotional states to tailor content in real time. For example, a student struggling with calculus might receive customized problem sets, while another excelling in literature could be guided toward advanced critical analysis.
		- AI will embed education into daily routinesâ€”e.g., language practice via AR glasses during commutes, or coding tutorials integrated into workflow tools like GitHub Copilot.

> [!NOTE]
> 		- Types of things that AI cant fill such as critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and ethics, are type of things that would make a good opportunities.
