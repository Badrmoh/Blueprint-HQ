# Properties
- Contextualize responses
- Autonomously reason over data
- Interactively assist users
- Segment data per category 
- Reason over cross-categorical data
-  Autonomously generate results (analysis, suggestions, ....)
- Minimizes user's interaction with the assistant through **continuous reasoning**

# Data Properties
- Data is privately stored on device
- Reasoning happens either:
	- over public LLMs: non-private data
	- over private SLMs: private data
- Tools could get contextual data, where sharing-data is unavoidable

# Workflow
- Data is continuously collected / ingested
- Autonomous reasoning happens at multiple periods
- Results are consciously shared with users (requires knowledge of user active context)
- Users could as well actively prompt the assistant for further needs
# External Integrations
- LLMs
- Tools
- OpenAI API (Agents, Assistants,...)
- Data ingestion sources:
	- other similar assistants could share data (cross-device contexts)
	- Sensors
	- Wearables
	- Camera
	- Voice
	- Text-Chat
	- local files
	- cloud storage
